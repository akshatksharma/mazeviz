# mazeviz
A simple, interactive visualization tool for a selection of pathfinding algorithms. Written in vanilla JavaScript. 

Included are both weighted (Dijkstra, A*) and unweighted (BFS, DFS) algorithms. These are implemented through a combination of minheaps, stacks and queues. 


### Controls
* Click and drag on any empty tile to set walls or weights. 
* Click and drag the start / end nodes to reposition them. 
* Choose an algorithm or adjust its speeds through their drop down menus
* Adjust performance impact with the color toggle
